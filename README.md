# OWASP Glue

Glue is a framework for running a series of tools.  It is intended as a backbone for automating a security analysis pipeline of tools.

# Recommended Usage

For those wishing to run Glue, we recommend using the docker image because
it should have the other tools it uses available already and configured.
See the documentation for more info.  [Glue Docker Documentation](./DOCKER.md)

For those interested in how to use Glue in a DevOps context, see
[Glue DevOps Integration Options](./DEVOPS.md)

Checkout the [Playground](./PLAYGROUND.md) to get a better understanding of Glue's features and how you can use them.

# Local run

`docker run owasp/glue`

# Installation for Development

```
git clone https://github.com/owasp/glue
cd glue                     -- RVM will set to 2.3.1 with Gemset Glue
gem install bundler
bundle install
```

## Running in Development

```
cd lib
../bin/glue -h
```

# Extending Glue

Glue is intended to be extended through added "tasks".  To add a new tool,
copy an existing task and tweak to make it work for the tool in question.

# Usage

`Glue <options> <target>`

## Options

Common options include:
```
-d for debug
-f for format (takes "json", "csv", "jira")
```

For a full list of options, use `Glue --help` or see the [OPTIONS.md](./OPTIONS.md) file.

## Target

The target can be:
* Filesystem (which is analyzed in place)
* Git repo (which is cloned for analysis)
* Other types of images (.iso, docker, etc. are experimental)


# Dependencies

* clamav
* hashdeep
* rm (*nix)
* git
* mount (*nix)
* docker

# Development

To run the code, run the following from the root directory:

`>ruby bin/Glue <options> target`

To build a gem, just run:

`gem build Glue.gemspec`


# Integration

## Git Hooks

First, grab the hook from the code.
```
meditation:hooks mk$ cp /area53/owasp/Glue/hooks/pre-commit .
```

Then make it executable.
```
meditation:hooks mk$ chmod +x pre-commit
```

Make sure the shell you are committing in can see docker.
```
meditation:hooks mk$ eval "$(docker-machine env default)"
```

Now go test and make a change and commit a file.
The result should be that Glue runs against your
code and will not allow commits unless the results
are clean. (Which is not necessarily a reasonable
expectation)


# Configuration files

For advanced usage scenarios, you can save your configuration and use it at runtime.
