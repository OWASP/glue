      "description": "## Overview\n[`ejs`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ejs) is a popular JavaScript templating engine.\nAffected versions of the package are vulnerable to _Remote Code Execution_ by letting the attacker under certain conditions control the source folder from which the engine renders include files.\nYou can read more about this vulnerability on the [Snyk blog](https://snyk.io/blog/fixing-ejs-rce-vuln).\n\nThere's also a [Cross-site Scripting](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:ejs:20161130) & [Denial of Service](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:ejs:20161130-1) vulnerabilities caused by the same behaviour. \n\n## Details\n`ejs` provides a few different options for you to render a template, two being very similar: `ejs.render()` and `ejs.renderFile()`. The only difference being that `render` expects a string to be used for the template and `renderFile` expects a path to a template file.\n\nBoth functions can be invoked in two ways.

      "description": "## Overview\n[`ejs`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ejs) is a popular JavaScript templating engine.\nAffected versions of the package are vulnerable to _Denial of Service_ by letting the attacker under certain conditions control and override the `localNames` option causing it to crash.\nYou can read more about this vulnerability on the [Snyk blog](https://snyk.io/blog/fixing-ejs-rce-vuln).\n\nThere's also a [Remote Code Execution](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:ejs:20161128) & [Cross-site Scripting](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:ejs:20161130) vulnerabilities caused by the same behaviour.\n\n## Details\n`ejs` provides a few different options for you to render a template, two being very similar: `ejs.render()` and `ejs.renderFile()`. The only difference being that `render` expects a string to be used for the template and `renderFile` expects a path to a template file.\n\nBoth functions can be invoked in two ways. The first is calling them with `template`, `data`, and `options`:\n```js\nejs.render(str, data, options);\n\nejs.renderFile(filename, data, options, callback)\n```\nThe second way would be by calling only the `template` and `data`, while `ejs` lets the `options` be passed as part of the `data`:\n```js\nejs.render(str, dataAndOptions);\n\nejs.renderFile(filename, dataAndOptions, callback)\n```\n\nIf used with a variable list supplied by the user (e.g. by reading it from the URI with `qs` or equivalent), an attacker can control `ejs` options. This includes the `localNames` option, which will cause the renderer to crash.\n\n```js\nejs.renderFile('my-template', {localNames:'try'}, callback);\n```\n\nThe [fix](https://github.com/mde/ejs/commit/49264e0037e313a0a3e033450b5c184112516d8f) introduced in version `2.5.3` blacklisted `root` options from options passed via the `data` object.\n\n## Disclosure Timeline\n- November 28th, 2016 - Reported the issue to package owner.\n- November 28th, 2016 - Issue acknowledged by package owner.\n- December 06th, 2016 - Issue fixed and version `2.5.5` released.\n\n## Remediation\nThe vulnerability can be resolved by either using the GitHub integration to [generate a pull-request](https://snyk.io/org/projects) from your dashboard or by running `snyk wizard` from the command-line interface.\nOtherwise, Upgrade `ejs` to version `2.5.5` or higher.\n\n## References\n- [Snyk Blog](https://snyk.io/blog/fixing-ejs-rce-vuln)\n- [Fix commit](https://github.com/mde/ejs/commit/49264e0037e313a0a3e033450b5c184112516d8f)\n",

      "description": "## Overview\n[`marked`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/marked) is a markdown parser and compiler used for rendering markdown content to html.\nAffected versions of the package allowed the use of `data:` URIs for all mime types by default potentially opening a door for Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks.\n\n## Details\nData URIs enable embedding small files in line in HTML documents, provided in the URL itself.\nAttackers can craft malicious web pages containing either HTML or script code that utilizes the data URI scheme, allowing them to bypass access controls or steal sensitive information.\n\nAn example of data URI used to deliver javascript code. The data holds `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` tag in base64 encoded format.\n```html\n[xss link](data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgnWFNTJyk8L3NjcmlwdD4K)\n```\n\n## Remediation\nThe fix is merged to the master branch but not yet published to npm.

      "description": "## Overview\n[`request`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request) is a simplified http request client.\nA potential remote memory exposure vulnerability exists in `request`. If a `request` uses a multipart attachment and the _body type_ option is `number` with value X, then X bytes of uninitialized memory will be sent in the body of the request.\n\nNote that while the impact of this vulnerability is high (memory exposure), exploiting it is likely difficult, as the attacker needs to somehow control the body type of the request. One potential exploit scenario is when a request is composed based on JSON input, including the body type, allowing a malicious JSON to trigger the memory leak.\n\n### Details\nConstructing a `Buffer` class with integer `N` creates a `Buffer`\nof length `N` with non zero-ed out memory.\n**Example:**\n```\nvar x = new Buffer(100); // uninitialized Buffer of length 100\n// vs\nvar x = new Buffer('100'); // initialized Buffer with value of '100'\n```\n\nInitializing a multipart body in such manner will cause uninitialized memory to be sent in the body of the request.\n\n#### Proof of concept\n```javascript\nvar http = require('http')\nvar request = require('request')\n\nhttp.createServer(function (req, res) {\n  var data = ''\n  req.setEncoding('utf8')\n  req.on('data', function (chunk) {\n    console.log('data')\n    data += chunk\n  })\n  req.on('end', function () {\n    // this will print uninitialized memory from the client\n    console.log('Client sent:\\n', data)\n  })\n  res.end()\n}).listen(8000)\n\nrequest({\n  method: 'POST',\n  uri: 'http://localhost:8000',\n  multipart: [{ body: 1000 }]\n},\nfunction (err, res, body) {\n  if (err) return console.error('upload failed:', err)\n  console.log('sent')\n})\n```\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `request` to version 2.68.0 or higher.\n\nIf a direct dependency update is not possible, use [`snyk wizard`](https://snyk.io/documentation/#wizard) to patch this vulnerability.\n\n## References\n- [Github PR](https://github.com/request/request/pull/2018)\n- [Blog: Node Buffer API fix](https://github.com/ChALkeR/notes/blob/master/Lets-fix-Buffer-API.md#previous-materials)\n- [Blog: Information about Buffer](https://github.com/ChALkeR/notes/blob/master/Buffer-knows-everything.md)\n",

      "description": "## Overview\nThe semver module uses regular expressions when parsing a version string. For a carefully crafted input, the time it takes to process these regular expressions is not linear to the length of the input. Since the semver module did not enforce a limit on the version string length, an attacker could provide a long string that would take up a large amount of resources, potentially taking a server down. This issue therefore enables a potential Denial of Service attack. This is a slightly differnt variant of a typical Regular Expression Denial of Service ([ReDoS](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS)) vulnerability.\n\n## Remediation\nUpdate to a version 4.3.2 or greater. From the issue description [2]: \"Package version can no longer be more than 256 characters long. This prevents a situation in which parsing the version number can use exponentially more time and memory to parse, leading to a potential denial of service.\"\n\n## References\n\n- [1] https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS\n- [2] https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v2.7.5\n",

If your application depends on url traversal, then you are encouraged to please refactor so that you do not depend on having ```..``` in url paths, as this tends to expose data that you may be surprised to be exposing.\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade to version 0.2.5 or greater.\n\n## References\n- https://github.com/isaacs/st#security-status\n- http://blog.npmjs.org/post/80277229932/newly-paranoid-maintainers",
